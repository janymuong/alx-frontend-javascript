# ES6 Basics
> ECMAScript  
>> Fundamentals of ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) in JavaScript. ES6 introduced various features and enhancements to the JavaScript language, and this project covers some of the key concepts.


## Premise

Entails exploring essential `ES6` concepts, including `constants`, `variables`, `block-scoped variables`, `arrow functions`, `rest and spread parameters`, `string templating`, *object creation*, and iterators with `for-of loops`. The goal is to create JavaScript code that exemplifies these concepts.

## Config And Linters

- `package.json`: The project's configuration file for managing dependencies and scripts.

- `babel.config.js`: Configuration file for Babel, which allows you to use ES6 features in your code.

- `.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration file to maintain code quality and adhere to coding standards.

## Getting Started

- Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

- Install from a package.json file - run `npm install` in the project directory to install the necessary dependencies.

## Concepts Covered:

```bash
- Constants and Variables
- Block-Scoped Variables
- Arrow Functions
- Default Parameters
- Rest and Spread Parameters
- String Templating
- Object Creation and Properties
- Iterators and for-of Loops
```

## Running Scripts

```bash
node parh/to/javascript-file.js
```
